# TAMU-SPE Desktop
Howdy! My name is Alberto Christian Alvarez, I served as the Secretary (2023-2024) for the Texas A&M Society of Petroleum Engineers, and am a proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2025. 

TAMU-SPE Desktop was developed as a passion project to combine my love for my student org with my love for coding and programming. Members can stay up-to-date with all upcoming events and browse information, including a push notification feature for both Mac and Windows.
