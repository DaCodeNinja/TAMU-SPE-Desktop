Howdy! My name is Alberto Christian Alvarez. I am a proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2025 and was honored to serve as Secretary (2023-2024) for the Texas A&M Society of Petroleum Engineers. TAMU-SPE Desktop is developed as a passion project combining love for my student org with love for coding and programming. TAMU-SPE Desktop is written entirely in Python, compiled in C using Nuitka.
