# TAMU-SPE Desktop
Howdy! My name is Alberto Christian Alvarez. I am a proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2025 and was honored to serve as Secretary (2023-2024) for the Texas A&M Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TAMU-SPE Desktop was developed as a passion project combining love for my student org with love for coding and programming. Members can stay up-to-date with all upcoming events and browse information, including push notifications for both Mac and Windows.
